## Questions/Answers I had to start with

### What is Apollo Server?
> Apollo Server is a library that helps you connect a GraphQL schema to an HTTP server in Node.js - [codingthesmartway](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/apollo-server-introduction-d24b593d4eda)

**NOTE:** Itâ€™s possible to use Apollo Server with all popular HTTP servers like [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

### What is Apollo Server?

Apollo Server is an implimentation on how to hook a server up to the GraphQL layer.

### What is Apollo Client?

Apollo Client is an implimentation on how to hook your GraphQL layer up to your client/web app or app. 

It allows you to use some helpful packages like: `apollo-boost`, `react-apollo` and `graphql` that helps connect your GraphQL layer with your client or website/app to React.

Originally I used this awesome Tutorial from Brad at [traversymedia](http://www.traversymedia.com/) which was great. Then I've replaced the `GraphQLSchema` API with the style in the [Apollo docs].(https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/essentials/data.html)
